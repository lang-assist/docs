# Documentation Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for developing comprehensive documentation for the Lang-Assist project. The roadmap prioritizes documentation efforts to maximize value for both human developers and AI agents working on the project.

## Documentation Priorities

Documentation will be developed in the following priority order:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate Priority)

1. **Project Structure and Architecture**

   - High-level system architecture
   - Component relationships
   - Technology stack overview
   - Repository structure

2. **Development Environment Setup**

   - Local development environment setup
   - Required tools and dependencies
   - Configuration guidelines

3. **Core Workflows**
   - Development workflow
   - Testing procedures
   - Deployment process

### Phase 2: Component Documentation (High Priority)

1. **Server Documentation**

   - API endpoints
   - Database schema
   - Authentication system
   - Business logic implementation

2. **Mobile App Documentation**

   - App architecture
   - State management
   - UI component library
   - Navigation system

3. **Admin Web Documentation**

   - App architecture
   - State management
   - UI component library
   - Admin-specific features

4. **GraphQL Schema Documentation**
   - Schema design principles
   - Type definitions
   - Query and mutation patterns
   - Resolver implementation

### Phase 3: Cross-Cutting Concerns (Medium Priority)

1. **Authentication and Authorization**

   - Authentication flow
   - User roles and permissions
   - Security considerations

2. **Data Flow**

   - Data lifecycle
   - State management patterns
   - Caching strategies

3. **Error Handling**

   - Error handling patterns
   - Logging strategy
   - Monitoring approach

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit testing approach
   - Integration testing
   - End-to-end testing
   - Test data management

### Phase 4: Advanced Topics (Lower Priority)

1. **Performance Optimization**

   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Optimization strategies
   - Benchmarking approaches

2. **Scalability Considerations**

   - Scaling strategies
   - Load balancing
   - Database scaling

3. **Internationalization and Localization**

   - i18n implementation
   - Translation workflow
   - RTL support

4. **Accessibility**
   - Accessibility standards
   - Implementation guidelines
   - Testing procedures

## Documentation Format

Each documentation area will include:

1. **Overview Document**

   - High-level explanation
   - Key concepts
   - Relationship to other components

2. **Detailed Implementation Guides**

   - Specific implementation details
   - Code examples
   - Best practices

3. **Decision Records**

   - Key architectural decisions
   - Rationale for implementation choices
   - Alternatives considered

4. **Diagrams and Visual Aids**
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Sequence diagrams
   - Data flow diagrams

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase   | Timeframe | Key Deliverables                                   |
| ------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 | Q2 2023   | Project structure, setup guides, core workflows    |
| Phase 2 | Q3 2023   | Server, mobile, admin, and GraphQL documentation   |
| Phase 3 | Q4 2023   | Auth, data flow, error handling, testing docs      |
| Phase 4 | Q1 2024   | Performance, scalability, i18n, accessibility docs |

## Documentation Maintenance

- **Review Cycle**: Documentation will be reviewed quarterly
- **Update Triggers**: Major feature additions, architectural changes
- **Ownership**: Each component team is responsible for maintaining their documentation
- **Quality Checks**: Documentation PRs will include review for accuracy and completeness

## AI Agent Specific Documentation

In parallel with the above phases, we will develop AI-specific documentation:

1. **Project Map Document** (Phase 1)

   - Central navigation document for AI agents
   - Links to all major documentation areas

2. **Context Maps** (Phase 2)

   - Relationship diagrams between components
   - Data flow visualizations

3. **Pattern Libraries** (Phase 3)

   - Common code patterns
   - Implementation conventions

4. **Decision Context** (Phase 4)
   - Historical context for decisions
   - Constraints and considerations

## Conclusion

This documentation roadmap provides a structured approach to developing comprehensive documentation for the Lang-Assist project. By following this plan, we will create documentation that serves both human developers and AI agents, improving development efficiency and knowledge sharing across the team.
