# Documentation Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the documentation standards and practices for the Lang-Assist project. These guidelines ensure consistency, clarity, and usefulness across all project documentation, making it easier for team members and AI agents to understand and work with our codebase.

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized into the following categories:

1. **Technical Documentation** (`/docs/public/technical/`)

   - Architecture overviews
   - API references
   - Code standards
   - Implementation details
   - Development workflows

2. **Design Documentation** (`/docs/public/design/`)

   - UI/UX guidelines
   - Design system documentation
   - Visual assets guidelines

3. **Business Documentation** (`/docs/public/business/`)

   - Product requirements
   - User stories
   - Market analysis
   - Business logic

4. **Tools Documentation** (`/docs/public/tools/`)

   - Development tools
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Testing frameworks

5. **Diagrams** (`/docs/public/diagrams/`)
   - System architecture diagrams
   - Flow charts
   - Entity relationship diagrams

## File Format Standards

1. **Markdown Format**

   - All documentation should be written in Markdown (`.md`) format
   - Use standard Markdown syntax for headings, lists, code blocks, etc.
   - For complex diagrams, use Mermaid or include links to Drawio diagrams

2. **Mermaid Integration**

   - Use Mermaid for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, etc.
   - Embed Mermaid diagrams within markdown using the following syntax:

   ````
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[Start] --> B[Process]
       B --> C[End]
   ````

   ```

   ```

## Documentation Content Guidelines

### 1. Document Structure

Each document should include:

- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title at the top (H1)
- **Overview/Purpose**: Brief explanation of what the document covers
- **Table of Contents**: For longer documents (optional)
- **Main Content**: Organized with appropriate headings (H2, H3, etc.)
- **Related Documents**: Links to related documentation (if applicable)
- **Last Updated**: Date of last significant update

### 2. Writing Style

- **Audience-Focused**: Write for the intended audience (developers, designers, AI agents, etc.)
- **Clear and Concise**: Use simple, direct language
- **Active Voice**: Prefer active voice over passive voice
- **Consistent Terminology**: Use consistent terms throughout all documentation
- **Code Examples**: Include relevant code examples where appropriate

### 3. Technical Documentation Specifics

- **Code Documentation**: Document classes, methods, and functions with clear descriptions
- **API Documentation**: Include endpoints, parameters, request/response examples
- **Configuration**: Document configuration options and environment variables
- **Dependencies**: List and explain external dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Document common errors and troubleshooting steps

### 4. AI Agent Considerations

- **Context Depth**: Provide sufficient context for AI agents to understand the system
- **Relationship Mapping**: Clearly explain how components relate to each other
- **Implementation Details**: Include important implementation details that may not be obvious from code alone
- **Decision Records**: Document why certain technical decisions were made

## Documentation Maintenance

- **Regular Updates**: Documentation should be updated whenever related code changes
- **Review Process**: Documentation should be reviewed for accuracy and clarity
- **Version Control**: All documentation is version-controlled in the same repository as the code
- **Deprecation Notices**: Clearly mark deprecated features or APIs

## Examples

### Example Class Documentation

````markdown
# UserService

## Overview

The UserService handles user authentication, profile management, and authorization across the platform.

## Methods

### authenticateUser(email, password)

Authenticates a user with email and password.

**Parameters:**

- email: string - User's email address
- password: string - User's password

**Returns:**

- AuthResult object containing user token and profile information

**Example:**

```typescript
const authResult = await userService.authenticateUser(
  "user@example.com",
  "password123"
);
```
````

```

## Conclusion

Following these documentation guidelines will ensure that our project remains well-documented, making it easier for team members to collaborate and for AI agents to provide accurate assistance. Documentation should be treated as a first-class citizen in our development process, with the same level of care and attention as code.
